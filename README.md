- To help give them the resources to transition, and safely once they are sure it the right path for them, which will likely include guides like how to change or delete things on social media, where to get clothes, how to find a therapist, how to shave, ect. 
- To give people a sense of Trans culture and of our history as a people and expand on the concept of who we are and where we came from. 
- To provide scientific backing and educational resources to help people defend themselves from transphobia. To route people into verified safe trans communities both on reddit and elsewhere that they can find support and camaraderie. 
- (Stretch) To provide ways for trans people to navigate the general world safely with things like company policy of work places they might be looking into, or places where travel hasn't been as safe.
